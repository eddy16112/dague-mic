# - Find the Omega library
# This module finds an installed  lirary that implements the 
# Omega polyhydral analysis tool (see http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/omega/).
#
# This module sets the following variables:
#  OMEGA_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the interface
#    is found
#  OMEGA_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full path name) to
#    link against to use OMEGA
#  OMEGA_INCLUDE_DIRS - uncached directories where the OMEGA header files are
